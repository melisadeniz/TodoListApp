# TodoListApp

### This is a basic To-do project building with React. ✔️
#### I developed the project by following [Dev Ed's](https://github.com/developedbyed) tutorial on Youtube. 
#### You can find the video at this [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCA4qpQDZD8&t=4224s).
#### It mostly involves using Props and Parent-Child Component Communication. Adding, completing and deleting functions are available. Keeps all entered tasks in localStorage.
