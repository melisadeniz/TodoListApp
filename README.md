# TodoListApp

#### This is a basic To-do project building with React. ✔️
#### I developed the project by following [Dev Ed's](https://github.com/developedbyed) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCA4qpQDZD8&t=4224s) on Youtube. 
#### Adding, completing and deleting functions are available. Keeps all entered tasks in localStorage. It mostly involves using Props and Parent-Child Component Communication.
